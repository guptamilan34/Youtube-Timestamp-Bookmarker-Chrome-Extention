# Youtube-Timestamp-Bookmarker-Chrome-Extention
I developed a Chrome extension using Manifest V3 and JavaScript that allows users to bookmark YouTube video timestamps. Key features include seamless bookmarking, playback, and deletion functionalities via event listeners, efficient script communication with Chrome Messaging and Tabs API, and data persistence using the Chrome Storage API.
